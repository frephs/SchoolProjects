                         <p>There was an electoral campaign that exposed the different arguments in favor of
               leaving or staying the European Union. This electoral campaign was aired as an
               advertisement, ran on various social networks and posters were hung for the cities; all of
               this influenced the choices of British citizens even if everything that was written there was
               not entirely true and right. These slogans were a way to influence people to vote yes,
               without them really knowing what they were voting for. In fact, after the referndum of 23rd
               June, many people asked to return to the polls because they realized they did not
               understand the importance of being within the European Union and the importance of this
               referendum. But ex Prime Minister Theresa May said “brexit is brexit” and from this
               moment all the negotiations to leave Europe began.</p>

                         <p>      The exit of the United Kingdom from the EU will have consequences not only on the British but on the entire world economy,
                              in fact, Brexit has brought many problems to the United Kingdom for which, during the transition period,
                              compromises will be sought with the EU there will be an inevitable no-deal.

                              For two months it seems that the two sides have entered a dead end, with each asking the other to give something to reach an agreement.
                         But without diplomatic efforts there would be serious economic consequences for both the EU and the UK and the UK could suffer the heaviest losses.
                         On 13 December 2020, formally the last day of negotiations between Ursula von del Leyen and Boris Johnson, it appears that the negotiations on the new
                         commercial agreement will continue indefinitely. </p>
                              <p>Negotiations are proceeding with difficulty, especially on the so-called level playing field, that is the rules that should prevent British companies
                              from competing unfairly with European ones. In recent days, the European negotiators had asked the British counterpart to introduce a clause to oblige
                              the United Kingdom to keep its environmental and labor standards updated in the medium to long term: but the British negotiators had accused the
                              European Union of actually wanting to maintain the country fully aligned with current European standards.</p>
                              <p>The negotiators are also discussing the access into British waters by European fishermen. The European Union has state that the denied access to
                              their fishing vessels into UK waters will cause for the British fishermen the inability to sell their goods on European markets.
                              The United Kingdom argues that what happens in its waters cannot be decided by entities now external such as the European Union.
                              The British government has also confirmed that the navy is preparing to patrol the waters in the event that an agreement is not reached.</p>
                              <p>
                              Another negotiation point on which there does not seem to be a solid agreement yet concerns the mechanisms that the United Kingdom and the
                              European Union should adopt to resolve any legal disputes.</p>

                             The Thatcherian revolution earned it the attribution of the term Thatcherism, a term that indicates the

                             spending and taxes and public policies in support of supply.

                              <p>Having become prime minister, Johnson also found the same problem as May with his new agreements
                                  signed with Brussels which was also rejected by the House of Commons.
                                  As a consequence, the prompt request for an early vote is inevitable, with the former mayor of London
                                  hoping to obtain a large majority in the elections that will allow him to pass his Brexit agreements.
                                  Johnson was able to get his Brexit agreements approved with the United Kingdom, which on January 30th
                                  officially left the European Union after years of negotiations.

                              <p>Theresa May is called to replace David Cameron and becomes the new British prime minister. May also
                                  takes a stand on the remain policy but, by carrying on the motto “Brexit means Brexit”, she shows
                                  however that she wants to remain faithful to the result of the vote and promises to find an agreement. In
                                  2017, Theresa May delivered to the President of the European Council Donald Tusk the official request
                                  for the activation of Article 50. This is the so-called Withdrawal Clause of the Treaty on European Union
                                  which provides for the voluntary and unilateral withdrawal of a country from the EU. </p>

                                   On 19/12/2020 the British parliament warns that the government is not yet able to tell companies, traders and citizens with certainty what will happen to the sectors involved. From this date, there are only 12 days left for the end of the transition period but it is certain that the UK is not sufficiently prepared for the exit from the single European market. </br>
                                   Britain and the Europian Unioneach hailed the Trade and Co-operation Agreement sealed on Christmas Eve as a triumph for their negotiators which secured their interests after Brexit on January 1st. But the deal, which covers issues like security, energy, transport and social welfare as well as trade, involved compromises on both sides and leaves Britain with a significantly weaker economic relationship with the EU.                              </p>
                              <h3>BORDERS</h3>
                              <p>
from 2021 a border will return between England and the European Union. Being an island, the country is already separated from the rest of the continent today. However, it will take a physical border between Northern Ireland, which belongs to the UK, and the Republic of Ireland, a member state of the EU. Planes and ships already have to carry out border checks and customs operations when they arrive in the UK today. Until the end of December, there is a temporary solution, the backstop, that makes sure there is a soft border between Ireland and Northen Ireland.                              </p>
                              <p>
                                   <h3>SCOTLAND</h3> Scotland is the most pro-European nation in the UK and has no desire to say goodbye to Brussels. The only way, according to Prime Minister Nicola Strugeon, is a referendum to bring Edinburgh back to Europe and for Scotland to become an independent nation. But the UK continues to decline this proposal.  Scotland will try to influence the negotiations in ways that could lead to Scotland, the UK and the EU. And in particular they will continue to emphasize the importance of having closer trade relations possible.
                              <p>
                                   <h3>PASSPORT AND VISA</h3>  From January 1st 2021 the United Kingdom will become a foreign country in all aspects and from February 1st, formally the United Kingdom will no longer be part of the area of ​​free movement of people and goods. Until now and for the transition period, that will conclude at the end of 2020, the Identity Card will be accepted to enter and visit the country. From 2021, however, to enter the UK, for any reason, you will need a passport. In addition, a visa will therefore be required to live and work in the country. Finally, if you wish to visit the United Kingdom for a short holiday, a 3 month tourist visa stamp will be placed on your passport at your arrival in the airport, allowing you to stay in the country without need to apply for a visa in advance.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                   <h3>TRADE IN GOODS</h3>  At the heart of the deal is tariff-free, quota-free access to each other’s market for goods, making it more expansive than any trade deal the EU has previously agreed with other major economies. But Boris Johnson’s assertion that the deal also eliminates non-tariff barriers to trade is not accurate. The two sides have agreed to introduce trusted trader schemes and self-verification systems to reduce the impact of the hard customs and regulatory border that will apply to all parts of the United Kingdom except Northen Ireland from January 1st. But there will still be checks and increased bureaucracy which will make trade costlier and more cumbersome and British produce authorisations will no longer be automatically accepted by EU regulators
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                   <h3>STUDENTS AND ERASMUS</h3>  a visa will also be required for students arriving in the country for short study holidays. While a completely different story concerns universities and Erasmus is eliminated. They will introduce its own scheme named after the computer scientist Alan Turning It will remain part of the Horizon Europe scientific research initiative.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                   <h3>IMMIGRATION</h3> there will be no limits to legal immigration, but only if the immigrant person will have a contact with a UK company previous entry the country and the payment must to be more than 30 thousand pounds a year. The measure serves to limit the entry of unskilled labor and encourage the entry of skilled foreign workers.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                   <h3>EU CITIZENS LIVING IN THE UK</h3>  In the UK today there are many people from other EU and non-EU countries. Citizens who have lived in Great Britain for at least 5 years will be granted the opportunity to apply for a permanent residence permit (no later than December 2020). On the other hand, those who have resided in the country for less than 5 years will have to apply for a temporary permit which will only be valid for five years. European citizens who fail to comply will risk being thrown out of the UK, according to Johnson's hard line. Anyone wishing to move to the UK will only be admitted after proving that they have already obtained a job. However, every European citizen will have to pay a fee of 625 pounds to the national health service.
                              <p>
                                   <h3>FISHERIES</h3>Fishing was among the most contentious issues in the negotiations, the last to be agreed and the only one where Britain was clearly in the stronger position. But the outcome involved a huge climbdown for Johnson, who until a few weeks ago was demanding an 80 per cent reduction over three years in the value of fish caught in British waters. The EU’s opening demand for no change in its current access to British waters was plainly unrealistic but under the deal, European boats will lose only 25 per cent of their catch, with the changes phased in over 5½ years. After that, quotas for EU boats will be worked out in annual negotiations but if Britain dramatically limits access to its waters, the EU can retaliate by closing EU waters to British boats or imposing tariffs. The bloc dropped a demand that it should be able to impose sanctions on other elements of British trade in response to any dispute over fisheries.
